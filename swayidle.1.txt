swayidle (1)
============

Name
----
swayidle - Idle manager for Wayland

Synopsis
--------
'swayidle' [options] [events...]

Options
-------

*-h*::
	Show help message and quit.

*-d*::
	Enable debug output.

Description
-----------

swayidle listens for idle activity on your Wayland compositor and executes tasks
on various idle-related events. You can specify any number of events at the
command line.

Events
------

*timeout* <timeout> <timeout command> [resume <resume command>]::
	Execute <timeout command> if there is no activity for <timeout> seconds.
	+
	If you specify "resume <resume command>", <resume command> will be run when
	there is activity again.

*before-sleep* <command>::
	If built with systemd support, executes <command> before systemd puts the
	computer to sleep.

All commands are executed in a shell.

Example
-------

 swayidle \
     timeout 300 'swaylock -c 000000' \
     timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' \
		resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
     before-sleep 'swaylock -c 000000'

This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off your
displays after another 600 seconds, and turn your screens back on when resumed.
It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
